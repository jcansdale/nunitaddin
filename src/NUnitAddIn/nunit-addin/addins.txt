NUnit Extensions
================

Place your NUnit extension assemblies in this directory.
If the extension references 'nunit.core' make sure that it's
compiled against the same version of 'nunit.core' that's in
the parent directory.

For example extension see the NUnit source distribution:
src\samples\Extensibility\Core\CoreExtensibility.sln
